profile:
  about: Until now, in my life, I change from active moments with a lot of variety, challenges and improvisations, to moments of tranquility and stability, being difficult to stay in a place during a long time. I consider myself a tolerant and respectful person with open mind and quite honest. I really like to listen people stories and backgrounds and their different experiences around the world.
